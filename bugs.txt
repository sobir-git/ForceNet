* On some computer (old one) the "ForceNet.freeze()" log appears twice in a row
also "PASSWORD DETECTED" appears twice. Also sometimes it freezes correctly but
cannot unfreeze on network connection. It will unfreeze when password typed.

* The service runs into exceptions when no user is logged on. You can see it on logs.
However it will not break the program, just dumps unnecessary logs.

* The service when spawns a new process it keeps the handle and checks the state of
process by this handle. However a user may run other instances as much as he wants. 
It will not have affects if there are a few instances,  but may become worse if there
will be many of them.

* The keypresses are logged and visible to user. This breaks the security rules. When password
is typed correctly the user may see it from logs!
