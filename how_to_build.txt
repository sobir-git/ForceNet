How to build
This is python 2.7
ForceNet version 0.3.0

The requirements:
	pywin32-224
	pyhook-1.5.1
	PyInstaller-3.4

Note: pywin32 can be installed by wheels or with pip
However there is a second step after installing pywin32. look at the 
official github repo.

Note: pyHook can be installed from wheels. I downloaded it from a famous
"Unofficial python packages" website...


RUN:
python -m PyInstaller main.spec
python -m PyInstaller forcenet_svc.spec

Then copy forcenet_svc.exe file into Forcenet_v* folder.
Make an installer using forcenet.iss (InnoSetup file)
The installation requires admin priviliges.

For manual installation:
	forcenet_svc.exe --startup auto install
	forcenet_svc.exe start
	That's all.

However you need to consider some:
. The forcenet_svc logs will be on C:\forcenet_svc.log
. The ForceNet logs will be saved on ~\ForceNet\logs. They logs files may
  get very large since debug level.
. Updating (overinstalling) is done only when service and processes manually removed. 
  Uninstalling also needs this.
